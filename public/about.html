<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I work for the Department of Health in Tampa as a Computer System analyst and manage over 16 remote offices throughout the area.</p>

<p>I love to learn new technologies. I am proud to acquire CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+ certifications in recent years. These wouldn't be the last certification either. My goal is to transition to be a Front End Developer by next year.</p>

<p>I enjoy spending my free time with my two kids and wife. It's amazed me every day to see how fast they have grown and learned new skills as toddlers.  </p>
